	<h1>Wolfy</h1>
     <img src="Wolfy Image.png" alt="A chubby white wolf with neon aqua blue hair and tip of tail. He wears a oversized green shirt and washed out blue pants." class="center">
      <p>Ethan (Wolfy) Murray is a 17-year-old wolf boy, who gets magic powers he can't control once moving to Wingden. His magic consists of him making blue wings and powerful spells, even though he is a beginner. </p>
	<p>Wolfy is that person who has major anxiety issues, he worries and overthinks way too much for his own good. And always tries to put others first besides himself, he sees himself more as a burden then company. But once getting to know him, you see he is a family man, he cares about his family and others he sees as family. It’s the highest trust he can give anyone.</p>

      <h1>Devil</h1>
      <img src="Devil Image.png" alt="A small light pink skinned demon. With short dark red hair and bright red horns, he tail has a bright red triangle on the end. He wears a black shirt and shorts. " class="center">
<p>Devil Demon is a 16-year-old demon boy, who seems like he showed up out of nowhere. He can't remember much but what he does know is magic, his love for strawberry milkshake, and hate for Angels. He met Wolfy by seeing him use magic and offering to help, sticking by his side ever since. </p>
     <p>Devil is a wild card, his chaotic and brash, can't stand still and annoys the people he hangs around with just for fun. But his also very sweet and understanding, putting their lives and safety before his own! Granted, a demon’s life can't die so easily. So, he is a good guy, but I wouldn't trust him with your kids.</p>

			  <h1>Johnson</h1>
			  <img src="Johnson Image.png" alt="A light Gray mouse, with fluffy/curly brown hair, tided into a ponytail. He wears blue jeans, a orange shirt and a red scarf tied around his neck." class="center">
			  <p>Johnson Squeaks is a 17-year-old mouse boy, who moved from the countryside to Wingden. His parents want to become posher and try to force him and his older sister to act like people they aren't. In a way to rebel and keep his history, Johnson always wears a red scarf around his neck, to remind him of where he came from.</p>
			  <p>Johnson believes if you work hard and put the effort in, good things will happen to you! So, he gets annoyed when he sees kids slacking off and still get good grades. And as much as he would want to tell those kids off, he fears he may lose the argument somehow or get in trouble. So, his reserves himself off to people. His not great at talking with others but his met two people and been able to talk with them with music! His friend’s names are Amber and Ky.</p>

			  	<h1>Amber</h1>
			  	<img src="Amber Image.png" alt="A light orange cat, with long pastel red hair, tied into a ponytail. She wears jeans that tie around her stomach and wears a long sleeved shirt with two button ups and a collar." class="center">
			  	<p>Amber Lee is a 17-year-old cat girl, who at a young age left her home due to a rotten Father. Her Mum told her where to go and gave her a backpack full of clothes and food. She then headed off and for a week she was walking alone, scared and fearing if her dad would find her. She then found a kindergarten, where a teacher told her to come inside, this is where she met Ky. Ky tried to talk with Amber and play games with her, but she kept quiet. At the end of the day Ky's dad, Albert, walked over to get Ky but saw Amber was alone, he saw no one else was around. Albert then waited with Amber until someone came for her, no one did. So, Albert took Amber in until someone came to get her, she’s been living with Ky and Albert ever since.</p>
			  	<p>Amber is a smart girl, one of the smartest people within the school! But most thought she was crazy for hanging around Ky. She got annoyed when people tried to "help" her get away from Ky, but she trusts Ky like no other person in that school. To others she’s standoff-ish and quiet, seeming like she hates others. But she’s just bad at conversations and social cues. But if you do gain trust with her you see her true colours! A Bubbly, goofy girl, who cares and helps anyway she can, she’s also quite smiley.</p>

			  <h1>Ky</h1>
			  <img src="Ky Image.png" alt="A Tall dark red fox, with poofy light red hair. With light red covering his lower face and tip of tail. He wears a green hoodie, with lighter green parts on the hood and pocket, with Gray sweat pants." class="center">
			  <p>Ky Dawson is a 19-year-old fox, who you won’t call ordinary, but not in the way you think. As family would call it, his artificial! His dad, Albert, was working towards being a scientist! And he wanted to make a monster to hurt the people who made fun of him in high school. He used his own DNA to make the monster, but something went wrong, and the monster started to fall apart! Sludge coming out of its eyes and screaming in pain. Albert tried to fix him, but the only way was to turn the monster into a baby! Turning the monster into a baby, keeping it stabilized, was Ky, doing baby things. After Albert seeing Ky like this, his mindset changed, feeling the need to help this child from danger. And that's what he does, he takes care of Ky, and some friends he did have in school, helped him too.</p>
			  <p>Ky is not the smartest tool in the shed, his better at things like talking with others (barely) and making music. Most kids in his school thinks his a heartless, problem causing monster. But it’s just been a lot of accidents and misleading information about him from his Ex, McKenzie. The only true thing she says about him is his anger issues. But other then, those incidents, his quite a nice soul. His easy to talk too and protects his family and close friends from anyone trying to hurt them. And he will do anything to protect them.</p>
