      <h2>Hello! Thank you for wanting to know more about me! That's so sweet of you! </h2> 
      <p>My name is Rebecca Stories, I’m in my last year of high school and I’ve come up with this story since I started high school! (Cuz a new friend of mine at the time introduced me to art and I was hooked ever since)</p>
      <p>I like playing role play/life sim games! Like Pokémon and Animal crossing.   I have a pet rabbit named Obi and his a little annoying sometimes but gets away with it by being adorable.</p>
      <p>I watch a LOT of animated shows, TV and YouTube. I love animation and it’s just so cute seeing people you make move. But ALSO like, what, how do YouTube have such good animation!? Like its sooooo good! </p>
      <p>My favourite pass time is playing games and watching YouTube videos cuz I’m indecisive. Whoops. I’m also a part of the LGBTQ+ community! And support all who are a part of it too, love you guys!</p>
      <p>And finally, I love making original characters! But half of them don’t do anything as I just draw and its new, so I have many children, another whoops.</p>
      <p>That’s all I can think about myself for now, maybe I’ll add Q&A sometime, who knows! But thank you for reading all this, you care so much, much love! But I’ll go now, talk later!</p>
      <h2>BYEEEE</h2>
